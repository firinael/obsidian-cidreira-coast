# obsidian-cidreira-coast-theme

## THIS THEME IS LIGHT-MODE ONLY!

### to-do
- [ ] add Style Settings support
- [ ] fix footnotes bug (consult @foreveryone)

### this theme is 99% derived from [California Coast Theme](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-california-coast-theme), which is derived from [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal).

It looks the best with almost everything from Hider turned on, and with the "translucent background" option on as well.
